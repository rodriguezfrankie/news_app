# news_app
In this app creating a news app that gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. 
Using the  Guardian API assigned in this course. This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.

Currently I’m working with this API.

For this assignment this is what I need to do:

Explore the API, then begin work in Android Studio. Start with a simple layout to test retrieving and displaying data from the API.
Then, build the AsyncTask that queries the API. This can be a complex step, so be sure to reference the course materials when needed.
Once API is queried, parse the results. This will involve storing the information returned by the API in a custom class.
Finally, use the List and Adapter pattern to populate a list on the user's screen with the information stored in the custom objects you wrote earlier.

*I am currently trying to get a response from the API but I still cannot get it to retrieve the data.*
